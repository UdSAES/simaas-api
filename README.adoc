= A _Simulation as a Service_-Implementation: API

image:https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg[alt=JavaScript Style Guide, link=https://standardjs.com]

[.lead]
This repository contains the API component of an implementation of the _Simulation as a Service (SIMaaS)_-concept based on the https://fmi-standard.org[Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)] that uses dedicated worker-processes to execute simulation jobs distributed using a task queue. Find the worker implementation at https://github.com/UdSAES/simaas-worker[https://github.com/UdSAES/simaas-worker] and an example that demonstrates the abilities of both at https://github.com/UdSAES/simaas-demo[https://github.com/UdSAES/simaas-demo].

Design concepts, software architecture and applications are discussed here:

== Installation
The code can be executed directly on GNU/Linux host machines or containerized using Podman or Docker. In both cases, some environment variables (ENVVARs) must be set according to the table below.

=== Configuration
All environment variables without a default value MUST be set before starting the program. Otherwise, a fatal error will be raised and the program will terminate with a non-zero exit code.

[#tbl-envvars,options="header",cols="2,5,1"]
|===
| Environment Variable
| Description
| Default Value

| `SIMAAS_SCRATCH_BUFFER_SIZE`
| The size of the `SCRATCH`-buffer in `amqplib` in bytes -- MUST be larger than the largest `modelDescription.xml` of the FMUs you use!footnote:[See `scripts/set_buffer_size_amqplib.js`]
| `65536`

| `SIMAAS_TMPFS_PATH`
| The path at which to store temporary files. Should be a `tmpfs`-mount for better speed but can be a normal directory, too.
| --

| `SIMAAS_FS_PATH`
| The path of the directory in which to store FMUs and other persistent data such as the internal list of model representations or the up-to-date OpenAPI-Specification. Should be on a volume if running containerized so the state survives container restarts.
| --

| `SIMAAS_RABBITMQ_HOSTNAME`
| The hostname of the RabbitMQ-instance
| --

| `SIMAAS_RABBITMQ_USERNAME`
| The username for the RabbitMQ-instance
| --

| `SIMAAS_RABBITMQ_PASSWORD`
| The password for the RabbitMQ-instance
| --

| `SIMAAS_REDIS_HOSTNAME`
| The hostname of the Redis-instance
| --

| `SIMAAS_LISTEN_PORT`
| The port on which to listen to incoming requests
| --

| `SIMAAS_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD`
| The period in milliseconds at which to log heartbeat-messages
| `3600000`

| `LOG_LEVEL`
| The minimal included https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan#levels[log level] that shall be printed to `stdout`
| `"INFO"`

| `UI_STATIC_FILES_PATH`
| The path to any static HTML file to be exposed; intended for rendered version of OAS
| `./lib/redoc.html`

| `UI_URL_PATH`
| The URL path at which to expose the static HTML file
| `/ui`

|===

=== Running from Code
* Ensure that https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js] is installed
* Install the dependencies by running `npm install`
* Apply a patch for an insufficient buffer size  by running `node scripts/set_buffer_size_amqplib.js`
* Start a https://redis.io/[redis] server and a https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ] server
* Start at least one instance of the https://github.com/UdSAES/simaas-worker[simaas-worker]
* Set the required ENVVARs, for example by putting `export SIMAAS_*=...`-statements in a file named `.env` and then loading the contents of this file via `source .env`
* Start the API by running `node index.js`
* Logs are serialized as JSON, so readability in a terminal increases greatly if the output is piped to https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq]

=== Running Containerized
* Ensure that a container engine such as https://www.docker.com/[Docker] or https://podman.io/[podman] are installed and running.
* Start instances of https://hub.docker.com/\_/redis[redis] and https://hub.docker.com/\_/rabbitmq[RabbitMQ] (both available on dockerhub)
* Build the container image, e.g. using `podman build -t simaas-api:latest .`
* Start at least one instance of the https://github.com/UdSAES/simaas-worker[simaas-worker]
* Set the required ENVVARs, for example by putting `export SIMAAS_*=...`-statements in a file named `.env` and then loading the contents of this file via `source .env`
* Run the API as a container, e.g.:
+
[source,sh]
----
podman run \
  --name simaas-api \
  --env SIMAAS_RABBITMQ_HOSTNAME=... \
  --env SIMAAS_RABBITMQ_USERNAME=guest \
  --env SIMAAS_RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=guest \
  --env SIMAAS_REDIS_HOSTNAME=... \
  -p 3000:3000 \ # <1>
  --rm -d \
  simaas-api:latest
----
<1> Within the container image, `SIMAAS_LISTEN_PORT` is set to 3000 and exposed, so port 3000 needs to be mapped to a port on the host.
* Access the service instance in a browser using the URL `http://localhost:3000`
* Logs are serialized as JSON, so readability in a terminal increases greatly if the output is piped to https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq]

== Usage
Once all required components are running, you can access the API documentation at `/ui`. It is rendered from the link:oas/simaas_oas3.json[OpenAPI-Specification (OAS)] using https://github.com/Redocly/redoc[ReDoc].

Initially, the service instance does not know about any models. Therefore, you have to push a model to the service instance first. The model needs to be an FMU 2.0 for co-simulation that includes binaries for GNU/Linux. Two supported FMUs can be found in the https://github.com/UdSAES/simaas-demo[simaas-demo]-repository. Optionally, the name(s) of one or more recordsfootnote:[This assumes that the FMU is created based on a Modelica model; the name of any component that groups the desired parameters should work.] used for storing parameters can be supplied. These will then be used to filter the full list of parameters read from `modelDescription.xml` in order to only expose those parameters that should actually be accessible through the API.

Once a model was successfully added, the OAS is updated and details on how to add model instances and simulate them become available.

_If you run into a problem or have a question, please open an issue! Thank you very much._

== Roadmap
We will work on the follwoing issues in the near future:

* [ ] bring back API and unit tests (already exist but need updating)
* [ ] clarify additional restrictions posed on FMUs
* [ ] remove as many of these restrictions as possible
* [ ] investigate relation to and possible use of (parts of) the https://ssp-standard.org/[SSP-standard]

Additionally, we will add new features/functionality, including:

* [ ] add graph-based representation format in addition to JSON (Turtle, N3, JSON-LD)
* [ ] derive triples about FMUs upon uploading
* [ ] add metadata, context and controls to resource representations

Adding this functionality will not break the REST-based HTTP-API described in the paper -- after all, this is what content negotiation is for :wink:.
